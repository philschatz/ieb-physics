<h3>Newton's First, Second and Third Laws</h3>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>State Newton's first law: An object continues in a state of rest or uniform (moving with constant) velocity unless it is acted upon by a net or resultant force</li><li>Define inertia as the property of an object that causes it to resist a change in its state of rest or uniform motion</li><li>State Newton's second law: When a net force, , net F is applied to an object of mass, m, it accelerates in the direction of the net force. The acceleration, a, is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to the mass</li><li>Solve problems using&nbsp;</li><li>Apply Newton's laws to a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium problems. (e.g. Discuss, using Newton's first law, why it is important to wear seatbelts) (e.g. Use Newton's second law to solve problems including an object moving on a horizontal/inclined plane (frictionless and rough), vertical motion (e.g. Rockets, hoisting masses etc.) and also twobody systems such as two masses joined by a light (negligible mass) string moving in a straight line either vertically or horizontally)</li><li>State Newton's third law: When object A exerts a force on object B, object B simultaneously exerts an oppositely directed force of equal magnitude on object A</li><li>Identify action-reaction pairs (e.g. for a donkey pulling a cart, for a book on a table)</li><li style="">Demonstrate an understanding of the properties of action-reaction pairs (are equal in magnitude, act in opposite directions, act on different objects, occur simultaneously, act along the same line)</li></ul><h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2><p>There are two main questions that we need to answer in this section:</p><ul><li>What is a force?</li><li style="">Why do objects change their motion?</li></ul><p>A common sense definition of a force is a push or a pull. At this stage, we want to&nbsp;know more about forces and understand their effects.</p><p style="">A few important points:</p><ul><li>A force is a vector quantity. It has both magnitude and direction.</li><li style="">A force acts on an object. It is important to always identify which object&nbsp;is experiencing the force.</li><li style="">A force requires an agent and every force is caused by an agent. If you&nbsp;are throwing a ball, your hand is the agent and is causing a force to be&nbsp;exerted while it is in contact with the ball. A falling object experiences&nbsp;a force due to the non-contact force of gravity. (diagrams or examples&nbsp;needed)</li></ul><h2>Some common forces</h2><p style="">In order to get started, we need to know about some common forces.</p><h3>Gravity</h3><p style="">Is a non-contact force and is responsible for keeping you on the surface of the&nbsp;Earth. It is also the force responsible for keeping the Earth in its orbit around the&nbsp;Sun.</p><p style="">Gravitational force is defined as the force the Earth exerts on an object on or&nbsp;near its surface. When an object is at rest on the surface of a planet we refer to&nbsp;the weight of the object.</p><p>We can calculate the gravitational force using the formula:</p><div class="equation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow>
